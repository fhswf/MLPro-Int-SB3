**Results**

The MuJoCo Cartpole environment window appears. Afterwards, the training runs 
for a few episodes before terminating and printing the result. 
    
After termination the local result folders contain the training result files:
    - agent_actions.csv
    - env_rewards.csv
    - env_states.csv
    - evaluation.csv
    - summary.csv
    - trained model.pkl

Both training results are from the same agent.
